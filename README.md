# Reactimio

## What is it?

It's a react starter pack with the usual local server, webpack build process.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
