Current version: 0.7.6,

Upcoming version: 1.0.0-RC1

## What is it?

It's a react starter pack with the usual local server, webpack build process, but that also contain some components. (header, login component, etc).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
In order to customize, select the tools / components to import in your project, you will need to install beforehand:

* [NODE.js](https://nodejs.org) - As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.

## The road so far...

### Happy to announce that we have:
  * Implemented a basic react starter
  * Added a couple of components (login form)

### Improvements to come
  * Add more components / improve existing ones

### Going forward
  * Always stay up to date

## Ok, I want to use it

Good, now a step by step series of examples that tell you have to get the package running
